# The graph shows the daily distribution of tweet sentiments (Negative, Neutral, Positive)
# from July 14 to July 21, 2020. Negative sentiments (red) consistently dominate across all 
# days, with notable peaks on July 15 and July 21. Positive sentiments (blue) are the second
# most frequent, showing a steady rise, particularly on July 21. Neutral sentiments (yellow)
# are generally the least represented and fluctuate more than the other categories. The chart
# indicates that during this period, the majority of tweets had negative sentiments, with 
# positive sentiment increasing toward the end of the timeframe.
